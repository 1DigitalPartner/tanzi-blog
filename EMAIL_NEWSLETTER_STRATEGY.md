Week of [DATE]

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Here's what the data revealed this week:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 DATA POINT OF THE WEEK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Posts with user-generated content get 79% more engagement than brand-created content.

But here's what's surprising: Only 23% of brands actively encourage UGC in their captions.

🎯 QUICK WIN: Add "Tag us in your photos" to 3 posts this week.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨 TREND ALERT  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LinkedIn carousel posts are crushing it right now.

I analyzed 1,200+ LinkedIn posts last week:
• Carousels: 2.3x more comments
• Carousels: 4.1x more shares  
• Single images: Standard engagement

Pro tip: Create 5-7 slide carousels with data insights.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👀 COMPETITOR SPOTLIGHT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Company Name] increased their LinkedIn engagement by 500% in 60 days.

Their strategy:
• Posted daily at 8:47 AM EST
• Used questions in 73% of captions

You can copy this approach in your industry.
