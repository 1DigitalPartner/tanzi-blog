  "body": "Hi {name},\n\nI just analyzed 125 data science posts with 118,001 total interactions and discovered something that'll surprise you...\n\n**Most data science professionals are doing content completely wrong.**\n\nHere's what the data revealed:\n\nðŸŽ¯ **Shorter content wins**: High-performing DS posts average 110 characters (not the 500+ word articles everyone recommends)\n\nðŸ“Š **Questions kill engagement**: 0 out of 5 top posts used questions. Definitive statements establish authority instead\n\nðŸ”¥ **Numbers paradox**: Only 1 out of 5 viral posts heavily featured data visualizations. Story + selective data points outperform pure stats\n\n**The Real Insight:**\nReddit generates 6.4x more engagement than Twitter for data science content, but most DS professionals ignore Reddit entirely.\n\n**What this means for your career:**\nWhile your peers are fighting for attention on LinkedIn with lengthy technical posts, you could dominate Reddit with strategic, data-backed insights.\n\nI've documented the complete analysis including:\nâ€¢ The exact 110-character formula that drives engagement\nâ€¢ Platform-specific success rates and optimization strategies  \nâ€¢ 5 psychological triggers that make DS content go viral\nâ€¢ Competitive analysis of top-performing DS influencers\n\nWant the full analysis? It's based on real performance data from 118,001 interactions.\n\nJust reply \"DATA\" and I'll send it over.\n\nBest,\nGabriele Tanzi\nTanziTech - Data Science Intelligence\n\nP.S. One of the posts I analyzed hit 25,310 likes by breaking every \"best practice\" rule. I'll show you exactly what they did differently.",
