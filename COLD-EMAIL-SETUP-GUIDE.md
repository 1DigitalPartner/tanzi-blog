## 🎯 **SEQUENCE STRATEGY**

### **Email Sequence Framework:**

#### **Email 1: Insight + Question (Day 1)**
- **Goal:** Get attention with valuable insight
- **Structure:** Research insight → Question → Soft CTA
- **Length:** 80-120 words
- **CTA:** Simple question or meeting request

#### **Email 2: Value + Social Proof (Day 3-4)**
- **Goal:** Build credibility and provide value  
- **Structure:** Compliment → Value insight → Case study → CTA
- **Length:** 100-150 words
- **CTA:** Offer free resource or audit

#### **Email 3: Problem + Solution (Day 7-8)**
- **Goal:** Highlight specific problem and solution
- **Structure:** Problem identification → Impact → Solution → Proof
- **Length:** 120-180 words  
- **CTA:** Specific meeting request

#### **Email 4: Final Value + Close (Day 14-18)**
- **Goal:** Last chance with maximum value
- **Structure:** Final value → Time sensitivity → Easy out
- **Length:** 100-140 words
- **CTA:** Yes/no decision request

### **Subject Line Framework:**

#### **Effective Patterns:**
```
✅ {{firstName}}, {{insight}} at {{companyName}}
✅ {{firstName}}, saw {{companyName}}'s {{achievement}}  
✅ {{firstName}}, {{problem}} costing {{companyName}} ${{amount}}?
✅ {{firstName}}, {{competitor}} vs {{companyName}} (data inside)
✅ Quick question about {{companyName}}'s {{challenge}}
```

#### **Avoid These Patterns:**
```
❌ "Quick question" (overused)
❌ "Following up" (sounds salesy)  
❌ "Partnership opportunity" (generic)
❌ "Increase your ROI" (too promotional)
❌ ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!
```

        if (validation.isValid && validation.confidence > 85) {
            validatedProspects.push({
                ...prospect,
                validationScore: validation.confidence,
