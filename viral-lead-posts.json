      "content": "I spent 4 months analyzing growth data from 200 SaaS startups (from pre-revenue to $10M ARR) and found that conventional growth wisdom is fundamentally flawed.\n\n**Common advice that actually hurts growth:**\n- Focus on viral coefficient and K-factor optimization\n- Prioritize feature development over user experience  \n- Scale marketing channels before achieving product-market fit\n\n**What the fastest-growing SaaS companies actually do:**\n- Obsess over Time-to-Value (TTV) - median 3.2 days vs 14.7 for slow growers\n- Manual onboarding until 100+ customers (automation comes later)\n- Single channel mastery before expanding (not multi-channel from day 1)\n\n**The data breakdown:**\n- Top 10% achieved 400%+ growth with average CAC of $127\n- Bottom 50% burned through $2.3M average before finding sustainable growth\n- 73% of failed startups had technically superior products\n\n**Key insight:** Product quality matters less than implementation speed and user success.\n\nThe companies that scaled fastest treated early customers like case studies, not statistics.\n\nDetailed methodology and full dataset available at the link above. \n\nThoughts on this?
